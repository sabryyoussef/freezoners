# Phase 1: Basic Model Structure Migration

## Overview
This phase focuses on migrating the basic models that have minimal dependencies. These models form the foundation of the module and need to be migrated first to ensure a stable base for subsequent phases.

## Models to Migrate

### 1. exception.py
**Purpose**: Basic exception handling
**Migration Tasks**:
- Update exception class definitions to Odoo 18 standards
- Review and update error handling mechanisms
- Implement new exception types if needed
- Update exception messages and logging

### 2. move.py
**Purpose**: Basic move operations
**Migration Tasks**:
- Update model definition to Odoo 18 standards
- Review and update field definitions
- Implement new move operation features
- Update move validation logic

### 3. rating.py
**Purpose**: Rating system
**Migration Tasks**:
- Update rating model structure
- Implement new rating calculation methods
- Update rating display and computation
- Add new rating features from Odoo 18

### 4. document_request.py
**Purpose**: Document request handling
**Migration Tasks**:
- Update document request model
- Implement new document request workflow
- Update request validation and processing
- Add new document request features

## Technical Implementation Steps

### For Each Model:
1. **Model Definition Update**
   ```python
   # Odoo 18 Model Definition Template
   from odoo import models, fields, api
   
   class ModelName(models.Model):
       _name = 'model.name'
       _description = 'Model Description'
       
       # Fields will be updated here
   ```

2. **Field Updates**
   - Replace deprecated field types
   - Update field attributes
   - Implement new field features
   - Update computed fields

3. **Method Updates**
   - Update compute methods
   - Implement new API methods
   - Update business logic
   - Add new features

4. **Security Updates**
   - Update access rights
   - Implement new security rules
   - Update user groups

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- Test model creation
- Test field computations
- Test business logic
- Test constraints

### Integration Tests
- Test model relationships
- Test workflow processes
- Test data integrity

## Migration Checklist

### For Each Model:
- [ ] Review current model structure
- [ ] Update model definition
- [ ] Update field definitions
- [ ] Update methods
- [ ] Update security
- [ ] Write/update tests
- [ ] Document changes
- [ ] Test migration
- [ ] Verify functionality

## Dependencies
- Odoo 18.0
- Python 3.10+
- Required Odoo modules:
  - base
  - mail (if using mail features)
  - web (if using web features)

## Notes
- Keep original models in place until migration is complete
- Document all changes for rollback purposes
- Test each model independently
- Update documentation as changes are made

## Next Steps
After completing Phase 1:
1. Review all migrated models
2. Run comprehensive tests
3. Document any issues
4. Proceed to Phase 2

## Support
For issues during Phase 1 migration:
1. Check Odoo 18 documentation
2. Review migration logs
3. Contact development team
4. Refer to main migration guide
